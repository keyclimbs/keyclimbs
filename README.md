### 👋Hi there, I'm Key 

I'm a passionate Cyber Security enthusiast with a deep-seated interest in the intersection of computer science and cybersecurity. My journey spans various areas, including neural networks, cryptography, and binary exploitation. I thrive on exploring complex systems and uncovering vulnerabilities to enhance security and resilience.

When I'm not immersing myself in the latest cybersecurity developments or tackling intricate coding challenges, you'll find me running through trails🏃‍ or scaling rock faces🧗. These pursuits help me stay agile, both mentally and physically, and fuel my curiosity and determination.

Driven by a commitment to safeguard digital spaces and advance technological understanding, I aim to contribute to the cybersecurity community through innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning.
